# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 - unreleased

- Add the publishable `rustleaks-core` package with a synchronous, byte-first
  configuration and detection API.
- Package the pinned upstream default configuration and implement custom rules,
  extension merging, selection, required rules, allowlists, decoding,
  composites, redaction, fingerprints, baselines, ignores, and sessions.
- Add controlled scans with cooperative cancellation and explicit work,
  decoded-byte, and finding-record budgets.
- Add unpublished Rust source, archive, Git, report, CLI, compatibility, and
  codec workspace crates.
- Add native Rustleaks config, ignore, flag, environment, and allow-marker
  names while retaining the upstream spellings for backward compatibility.
- Differentially test the pinned compatibility profile against a bounded Go
  oracle and committed corpora.

Native runtime validation is currently limited to Apple Silicon macOS. Linux,
Windows, Intel macOS, and musl native validation remain release prerequisites.
