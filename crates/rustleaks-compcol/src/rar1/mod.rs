//! RAR 1.x (1995-1996) — building-block library, no end-to-end decoder.
//!
//! RAR 1.x is the original Roshal Archive format and was in active use for
//! roughly twelve months in 1995-1996 before RAR 2.0 displaced it. There is
//! **no published specification** for the 1.x compression algorithm: the
//! only surviving open-source reference is The Unarchiver / XADMaster's
//! `XADRAR15Handle.m` (LGPL 2.1+, copyright MacPaw Inc.), which is itself a
//! reverse engineering of the original DOS-era binary.
//!
//! ## What this module ships
//!
//! Per [`crate::traits::Algorithm`] + [`Encoder`] / [`Decoder`], the public
//! types you'd expect are all here, but the decoder **does not produce
//! decoded output** — see "What does not work" below.
//!
//! Internally the module ships the well-defined building blocks any RAR1
//! decoder needs:
//!
//! - `bits::BitReader` — MSB-first bit reader matching
//!   `XADRAR15Handle.m`'s `CSInputNextBit`/`CSInputNextBitString` consumption
//!   order (Huffman codes are flagged `shortestCodeIsZeros:YES`).
//! - `huffman::StaticHuffman` — canonical Huffman decoder. RAR1's
//!   Huffman trees are **all static** — they're never transmitted — so this
//!   takes pre-baked code-length arrays. Maximum code length is 12 bits;
//!   the alphabet size is a const generic so the same type covers the
//!   256-symbol length trees, the 257-symbol literal trees, and the small
//!   short-match selector tables.
//! - `window::Window` — 64 KiB LZSS sliding-window output buffer with
//!   literal / match emission primitives and a drain cursor for streaming.
//! - `lookup::LookupTable` — the self-adjusting 256-entry symbol cache
//!   used as `flagtable` / `literaltable` / `offsettable` in the reference
//!   implementation. Implements the reset / swap / rank-bump machinery
//!   described by the reverse-engineered notes.
//! - `offset_history::OffsetHistory` — the 4-deep ring of recent match
//!   offsets plus the `lastoffset` / `lastlength` registers used by the
//!   short-match selector branch.
//!
//! ## What does not work
//!
//! [`Decoder::decode`] / [`Decoder::finish`] return [`Error::Unsupported`]
//! on any non-empty input. The reason is **the static Huffman code-length
//! tables**: RAR1 doesn't transmit them, so any working decoder has to
//! ship them. They are not public-domain data; the only published forms
//! known to us are inside LGPL'd reverse-engineered code (The Unarchiver)
//! or in RARLAB's source whose licence forbids reuse. This crate is
//! permissively licensed, so the tables haven't been reproduced here.
//!
//! What this means concretely:
//!
//! 1. The bit reader, Huffman decoder, LZSS window, lookup tables, and
//!    offset history are all production-quality and unit-tested.
//! 2. A future change that introduces the static tables (either by
//!    clean-room re-derivation, or by re-licensing under terms compatible
//!    with the LGPL source) can wire them straight into
//!    `huffman::StaticHuffman::from_lengths` and into a new `decode`
//!    state machine — no rebuilding required.
//! 3. Until then, there is no way to decode an actual RAR1 stream from
//!    bytes alone.
//!
//! ## Fixture famine
//!
//! Even if the decoder existed, exercising it is hard: RAR1 files
//! essentially do not exist on the open internet in 2026. The few surviving
//! samples are tied up in archive-history mirrors and shareware
//! collections that often pre-date the algorithm's actual deployment
//! window. The integration tests under `tests/rar1.rs` therefore cover
//! the [`Decoder`] / [`Encoder`] surface (constructor, name, `Unsupported`
//! semantics) plus the building blocks via unit tests in each submodule.
//!
//! ## Encoder
//!
//! Permanently unsupported. RARLAB's unRAR licence forbids using its
//! source code to reconstruct the compression algorithm, and there is no
//! clean-room encoder for RAR1 anywhere. The [`Encoder`] type returns
//! [`Error::Unsupported`] from every method.
