//! RAR 5.x (2013-present) — LZ77/Huffman + new filters — **decoder only**.
//!
//! Reference: <https://www.rarlab.com/technote.htm> (partial — the wire-level
//! algorithm details are not in the public technote; the canonical format
//! description is the libarchive RAR5 reader, BSD-licensed). This decoder
//! was implemented from the libarchive reader's algorithm description, not
//! its code; no code is copied.
//!
//! # Encoder is intentionally unsupported
//!
//! RARLAB's unRAR license explicitly forbids using its source code to
//! reconstruct the RAR compression algorithm. Even clean-room
//! implementations of RAR decoders (libarchive, The Unarchiver) ship
//! decoder-only for that reason. The encoder in this module will
//! permanently return [`Error::Unsupported`].
//!
//! # What the decoder supports
//!
//! - Single-volume RAR5 LZ77+Huffman compressed-data runs.
//! - Cross-block table reuse (`table_present` bit set or clear).
//! - The four-deep distance LRU and the "repeat last match" command.
//! - The x86 E8 and x86 E8/E9 post-decompression filters (filter types
//!   1 and 2). Delta (type 0), ARM (type 3), and the rare types 4–7
//!   are recognised on the wire but return [`Error::Unsupported`].
//!
//! # What the decoder does *not* do
//!
//! - **No archive container parsing.** RAR5's outer container (signature,
//!   main header, file headers, multi-volume continuations, encryption,
//!   recovery records, …) is not decoded here. Callers extract the inner
//!   compressed-data run from the container themselves and feed it to
//!   the decoder's `decode()` method.
//! - **No solid-archive cross-file dictionary sharing.** RAR5's solid mode
//!   keeps the LZ window alive across consecutive file entries; this
//!   decoder treats every stream independently.
//! - **No filter chains for non-`X86Call` filter types.**
//! - **No CRC32/Blake2sp verification.** Those checksums live in the file
//!   header, not the compressed stream.
//!
//! # Calling convention
//!
//! Construct via [`Decoder::with_unpack_size`] when the caller knows the
//! expected uncompressed size (from the container header). The decoder
//! stops once that many bytes have been emitted, regardless of whether
//! more compressed input is available. For exploratory use, [`Decoder::new`]
//! constructs a decoder with no unpack-size cap; the decoder then stops
//! at the block carrying the `last_block` flag.
//!
//! The window size also comes from the container (file header bits 11..=15
//! encode `128 KiB << N`). [`Decoder::with_window_size`] applies an
//! explicit window; [`Decoder::with_unpack_size_and_window`] sets both.
